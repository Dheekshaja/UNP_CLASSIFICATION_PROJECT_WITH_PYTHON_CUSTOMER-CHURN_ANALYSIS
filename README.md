# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_CUSTOMER-CHURN_ANALYSIS

During my internship at United Network of Professionals, I worked on a Classification Project using Python focused on predicting customer churn based on telecom usage data. The project involved complete data preprocessing — removing duplicates, treating outliers using the IQR method, and converting categorical variables into numerical form. I performed exploratory data analysis to understand key churn indicators like frequency of usage, complaints, tariff plans, and customer status through visualizations and correlation analysis. Three machine learning algorithms — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier — were implemented to build predictive models. Their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores were compared to evaluate model performance. This project improved my understanding of classification modeling, feature engineering, and model evaluation, while strengthening my skills in Python for business-focused analytics.
